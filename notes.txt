brainstorming notes:
    - hero seems fairly straightforward, just make sure picture looks good at all responsive stages

    - top "navbar" should become transparent with just logo visible after scrolling down
        - smooth transition

    - inspect elements of hatch.co website, then create color palette variables in index.css (or what
    ever the topmost css file is)

    - 3 column layout should become vertical upon narrowing viewport width

    - 3 column layout should be its own component maybe with individual column components

    - App.js should just contain the router with the "/home" route that renders the landing page
        - add in comments for other potential routes

    extras that would be nice:
        - columns under "Your heading here" should be a changeable parameter for number of columns

        - add a footer at the bottom
            - something super simple, maybe just a logo like the navbar

        note: probably just make UI handle no larger than 1920 width, more is too much

time spent:
    - document setup (15 minutes)
        - structuring files
        - setting global CSS variables
        - importing media

    - hero component (1 hour)
        - encountered obstacle 1

    - navbar component (15 minutes)

    - columns (1 hour 15 min)
        - encountered obstacle 2

    - testing with Chrome, Firefox, Edge and mobile (5 minutes)

obstacles:
    1) can't get hero image to maintain aspect ratio and overflow when screen size changes
        - I have made banners like this before but the image used was already bigger
          than the viewport, so overflowing the parent container was automatic
        - This image is supposed to exactly fit the viewport, so you can't quite force
          an overflow

        solution: 
            - hard code width that is unrelated to viewport size
            - use @media screen sizes to change coded width to make hero responsive

    2) columns need to be repsonsive, so layout should transition into row layout when
       a certain screen width is reached

        solution:
            - use display: block upon reaching smaller screen width, then this shifts
              horizontal object layout into vertical
